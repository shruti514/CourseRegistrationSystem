# CMPE-272-DB-TESTING


You will see 3 classes :
Bootstrap :
Its like a main class
DatabaseConnector
Here Shraddha's code will go for JDBC connection
Queries
Here we have to write Queries based on use cases
You can directly run this code from any editor like eclipse or idea.
Also, I have added a POM file which will generate a JAR file with all the dependencies we will be using.

To create a .jar file you have run following command:
            mvn clean compile assembly:single
